# ZigBee

> Zigbee is a specification for a suite of high-level communication protocols using low-power digital radios. It's designed for use in areas like home automation, medical data collection, industrial control systems, and other applications that require secure and reliable wireless communication.

## Default Trust Center Link Key

Zigbee includes several layers of security, including AES-128 encryption, to ensure that data is transmitted securely across the network.

The Zigbee Default Trust Center Link Key is a predefined cryptographic key used in Zigbee networks to secure the initial joining process of a new device to the network. It's part of the security measures implemented within the Zigbee protocol to ensure that only authorized devices can join a particular network.

When a new device wants to join a Zigbee network, it must first establish a secure connection with the Trust Center. To do this, the device and the Trust Center use the Default Trust Center Link Key to encrypt their communication.

For the profile "Home Automation" the default Trust Center Link Key is : `ZigBeeAlliance09` (`"5A:69:67:42:65:65:41:6C:6C:69:61:6E:63:65:30:39"`).

You can use it in Wireshark: Edit > Preferences > Protocols > Zigbee NWK, then "New" and write the key in hex format.
